## Introduction

In the world of software development, writing clear, consistent commit messages is both an art and a necessity. Good
commit messages tell a story, help teammates understand changes, and make code history navigable. Yet, many developers
struggle with crafting meaningful commit messages that follow established conventions like
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Enter the **MCP Git Commit Generator** – a revolutionary
tool that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automatically generate conventional commit messages from your
staged git changes.

## What is the MCP Git Commit Generator?

The MCP Git Commit Generator is an intelligent MCP server that analyzes your staged git changes and automatically
generates conventional commit messages. Built with Python and leveraging the power of AI through the Model Context
Protocol, this tool bridges the gap between your code changes and descriptive, standardized commit messages.

### Key Features at a Glance

- **🤖 AI-Driven Analysis**: Automatically analyzes staged git diffs to understand the nature of your changes
- **📝 Conventional Commits Support**: Generates messages following the widely-adopted Conventional Commits specification
- **🔧 Flexible Integration**: Works with VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible clients
- **🐳 Docker-Ready**: Ships as a lightweight Docker container for easy deployment
- **🔍 Inspector UI**: Includes a debugging interface for testing and development
- **⚡ Multiple Transport Options**: Supports both stdio (default) and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transports

## The Problem It Solves

### Before: The Commit Message Struggle

Every developer has been there – you've made significant changes to your codebase, staged your files, and now you're
staring at the commit message prompt. Questions flood your mind:

- Should this be a `feat`, `fix`, or `refactor`?
- What scope should I use?
- How do I summarize these complex changes concisely?
- Am I following the team's commit message conventions?

The result? Either rushed, uninformative messages like "fix stuff" or spending precious development time crafting the
perfect commit message.

### After: Intelligent Automation

With the MCP Git Commit Generator, this friction disappears. The tool:

1. **Analyzes your staged changes** using git diff
2. **Understands the context** of modified files and their relationships
3. **Determines the appropriate commit type** (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
4. **Suggests relevant scopes** based on changed files
5. **Generates a complete conventional commit message** ready for use

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

The MCP Git Commit Generator is built with a clean, modular architecture:

```text
src/mcp_git_commit_generator/
├── __init__.py     # CLI entrypoint using Click
├── __main__.py     # Module launcher
└── server.py       # MCP tools implementation
```

### MCP Tools Exposed

The server exposes two primary MCP tools:

#### 1. `generate_commit_message`

This is the star of the show. The tool:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def generate_commit_message(
    repo_path: Optional[str] = None,
    commit_type: Optional[str] = None,
    scope: Optional[str] = None,
) -> str:
```

**Parameters:**

- `repo_path`: Optional path to git repository (defaults to current directory)
- `commit_type`: Optional commit type override (auto-detected if not provided)
- `scope`: Optional scope override (auto-detected if not provided)

**Process:**

1. Validates the git repository
2. Retrieves staged changes using `git diff --cached`
3. Analyzes file status and change patterns
4. Generates contextual analysis for AI processing
5. Returns a conventional commit message suggestion

#### 2. `check_git_status`

A utility tool that provides comprehensive repository status:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def check_git_status(repo_path: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
```

This tool reports:

- Staged files ready for commit
- Unstaged modifications
- Untracked files
- Current branch information

### Transport Flexibility

The tool supports two transport mechanisms:

- **stdio (default)**: Perfect for CLI integration and MCP clients
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Ideal for web-based interfaces and the Inspector UI

## Integration Ecosystem

### MCP Client Support

The tool seamlessly integrates with popular development environments:

#### VS Code Integration

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "mcp-git-commit-generator": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=${userHome},dst=${userHome}",
        "ghcr.io/theoklitosbam7/mcp-git-commit-generator:latest",
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

#### Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf

Similar JSON configurations enable the tool across different AI-powered development environments, making it accessible
regardless of your preferred IDE.

### Docker-First Approach

The tool ships as a Docker container, providing:

- **Consistent Environment**: Same behavior across different systems
- **Easy Installation**: No Python environment setup required
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user with minimal permissions
- **Portability**: Works on any system with Docker

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development

You've just implemented a new user authentication system:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add src/auth/ tests/auth/ docs/authentication.md

# Use the MCP tool (through your IDE)
# Generates: "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens"
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fixes

You've fixed a critical performance issue:

```bash
git add src/database/query.py tests/test_query.py

# Generates: "fix(database): optimize N+1 query in user profile loading"
```

### Scenario 3: Documentation Updates

You've updated project documentation:

```bash
git add README.md docs/api.md

# Generates: "docs: update API documentation and installation guide"
