Welcome to this blog. This is my new blog where I will post articles and/or coding notes regarding JavaScript/TypeScript, mostly focused on [Angular](https://angular.io/ "Angular's Homepage") related topics.

More specifically, I like the [Reactive](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/ 'RxJs') approach of an Angular app where it is possible. I'm also interested about State Management patterns and when we need to use an external library (e.g. [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita/), [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/), [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)) or to create an ours one.

Stay tuned.
